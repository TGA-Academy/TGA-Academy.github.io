        Owner & Head Instructor
      </p>
      <p>
        A black belt under Brent Burniston & Nic Gregoriades, Dmytro has been practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu since he was only 15 years old. Unlike most students today, his first exposure to this martial art was through the practice of MMA, as there were only a few schools that offered Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first several years, Dmytro was primarily focused on No-Gi grappling, but as the sport began to evolve and grow in popularity, he then had an opportunity to fully commit himself and specialize in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the opening of Raven Grappling, Dmytro continues strive to better himself as an instructor, practitioner and owner, under the direct guidance of Professor Brent Burniston and Professor Nicholas Gregoriades, of Subconscious Jiu Jitsu Association.
      </p>
      <p>
        As his journey in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu carries on, Dmytro's passion for self-improvement as well as sharing all that he has learned from close to 2 decades of experience, in both competitive and self-defense oriented styles has never been stronger. He is always commited in bringing a depth of practical knowledge to his students, whether they have casual or competitive aspirations.

      <p>
        Mike is a highly skilled and technical brown belt, who has been practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for over 10 years. However, prior to training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Mike has also had many years of experience in training Kung Fu, and understands the value that a martial art can bring to a person’s life. He is also a firm believer that whether it is for self-defense or competition, it is important to be learning a martial art that teaches techniques that are practical and work against resisting opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from being a life-long martial artist, Mike is also an avid student of injury prevention protocols as well as strength and conditioning programs. His knowledge has become invaluable for the school, as he is always keen on providing guidance on how to build and maintain longevity, whether it’s for training on the mats or for how to gracefully age into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s your first time meeting Mike or if you have trained with him in the past, you will quickly see that his passion for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and innate nature of being analytical, is what continues to drive him to be such a great practitioner and coach, to both his peers and students alike.
