  <h2>
    The Vision
  </h2>
  <p>
    Women VIP was born from the collaboration between <strong>Raven Grappling</strong> - known for its modern take on a Martial Arts training environment - and <strong>Thr1ve Martial Arts Systems</strong> - an organization dedicated to enhancing everyday resilience. It merges the values of personal development, healthy lifestyle, safety, community and support into a single experience.

      The Inspiration
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Women VIP (Valkyrie Initiate Program)</strong> - in Norse mythology, Valkyries are female handmaidens who walked the battlefield and escorted fallen warriors to Valhalla. They are strong, fearless, and a powerful symbol of victory after rest. This combined with the imagery of Yggdrasil - the tree of life - is the core visual of Women VIP.
